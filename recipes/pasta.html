        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces spaghetti or your favorite pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried basil)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice) to the skillet. Stir in the chopped basil, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy your delicious homemade pasta!</li>
