        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, olive oil, sugar, and salt. Gradually add the yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
